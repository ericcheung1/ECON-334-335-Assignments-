# Section 1: My Data Visualization Example[^1]

*My article is titled "Apple's iPhone Price Bump Is Part of Subtle Revenue-Boosting Strategy" written by Mark Gurman.*

*My data visualization is the first graph right the below the headline which plots the relationship between year on the x-axis and average revenue per device on the y-axis.*

**The data visualization helps us understand how Apple's revenue per device has been going up over the years**

**This data visualization avoids the issue of bad taste talked about in section 1.2.1 of SOCVIZ. It keeps the visualization simple while presenting all the information that is needed.**

# Section 2: WDI

```{r}
library(WDI)
library(tidyverse)

GDP <- WDI(
  country = c("MC"),
  indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD",
  start = 2002,
  end = 2022,
  extra = FALSE,
  cache = NULL,
  latest = NULL,
  language = "en"
)

ggplot(data = GDP, mapping = aes(x = year, y = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)) +
  geom_line()
```

GDP in Monaco has been increasing in between the years of 2002 and 2022 but with noticeable decreases around 2008 and 2020.
